This standard addresses the accounting treatment for Salam and Parallel Salam transactions. Salam is a sale whereby the seller undertakes to supply a specific commodity to the buyer at a future date in exchange for an advanced price fully paid at spot. The standard covers the accounting by Islamic banks for funds disbursed in a Salam contract as well as the goods received under a Salam contract. It also addresses parallel Salam transactions where an Islamic bank enters into a second Salam contract to acquire goods of similar specifications to fulfill its obligation in the first Salam contract.

FAS 28: Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales
This standard prescribes the accounting rules for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transactions for Islamic financial institutions. Murabaha is a sale of goods at cost plus an agreed profit margin. The standard covers various types of Murabaha transactions including the traditional Murabaha and Murabaha to the purchase orderer (MPO). It addresses issues such as initial recognition, subsequent measurement, profit recognition, deferred payment, early settlement discounts, and default scenarios. This standard supersedes the earlier FAS 2.

FAS 32: Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek
This standard establishes the principles of classification, recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for Ijarah (lease) transactions including their different forms entered into by Islamic financial institutions in both capacities as lessor and lessee. It covers operating Ijarah, Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (lease ending with ownership transfer), and sublease transactions. The standard addresses the accounting treatment for right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, subsequent measurement, modifications, and other related aspects. This standard supersedes the earlier FAS 8.

FAS 30: Impairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments
This standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of impairment and credit losses for various Islamic financing and investment assets, as well as provisions against onerous commitments. It introduces an expected credit loss approach for impairment assessment with a forward-looking 'expected loss' model. The standard covers financial assets and commitments exposed to credit risk, with specific guidance for different types of Islamic financing contracts.

FAS 35: Risk Reserves
This standard prescribes the accounting principles for risk reserves established to mitigate various risks faced by stakeholders, particularly profit and loss taking investors, of Islamic financial institutions. It covers the establishment and utilization of two main types of risk reserves: Profit Equalization Reserve (PER) and Investment Risk Reserve (IRR). The standard addresses when these reserves should be recognized, how they should be measured, and the required disclosures.
